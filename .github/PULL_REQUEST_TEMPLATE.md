  * pyenv has some powerful support for plugins and hook scripts. Please refer [Authoring plugins](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv/wiki/Authoring-plugins) for details and try to implement as some plugin if possible.
* [ ] Please consider contribute similar patch to [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv) since we have borrowed most of lines with the project
  * We are occasionally importing the changes from the rbenv. In general, you can expect some changes made in rbenv will be imported to pyenv too, eventually.
  * Generaly speaking, we sometime don't prefer to make some change in the core feature to keep compatibility with rbenv.
